 * An attestation is a signed statement about someone.
 * Like a gift - the sender gives, the recipient decides to accept.
 *
 * Empfänger-Prinzip: Stored at the recipient (to).
 * Only the sender (from) signs. The recipient controls visibility via metadata.
 *
 * Example: Anna attests "Ben helped in the garden"
 * - Anna creates: { from: anna, to: ben, claim: "...", proof: anna_sig }
 * - Stored at: Ben
 * - Ben decides: accepted = true/false (via AttestationMetadata)
